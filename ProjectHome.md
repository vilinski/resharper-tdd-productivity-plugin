# TDD Productivity Plugin for Resharper #

This is a plugin for the popular Visual Studio Addin [Resharper](Resharper.md).

This plugin adds additional Context Actions that reduce the keystrokes and mouse clicks required to perform Test Driven Development.

The goal of this project is to prototype features which make TDD in Visual Studio easier than the Drag & Drop programing that Visual Studio was designed for. It would be great if these features were rolled into Resharper or Visual Studio.
