Move type to new file in different project.
  * When cursor is on a class/interface name and is the second(or greater) type declared in a code file.  A new set of context actions(Yellow light bulb) options will appear.
  * A new menu option will be created for each project that is referenced by the current project.  i.e. if you are in a UnitTest project the projects that are already referenced by this project will show up.

Here is an example of the context action working in the MvcContrib source code.
