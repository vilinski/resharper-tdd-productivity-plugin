=== Details ===

1. Move type to new file in different project.
  * When cursor is on a class/interface name and is the second(or greater) type declared in a code file.  A new set of context actions(Yellow light bulb) options will appear.
  * A new menu option will be created for each project that is referenced by the current project.  i.e. if you are in a UnitTest project the projects that are already referenced by this project will show up.
  Here is an example of the context action working in the MvcContrib source code. The items circled in red were added by this plugin.

3. Create interface in a referenced project.

4. Auto update.
  On startup the plugin will make a single web request to a text file in the projects source code repository.  The file that it calls is http://resharper-tdd-productivity-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/LatestVersion/version.txt  This call does not collect any information about the user of the plugin and is not tracked in anyway.
